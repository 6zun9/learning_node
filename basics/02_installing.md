# Installing Node.js

head over to the [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version of the node. The current version will have all the latest feature but may not be stable. So, for most of the cases we download the LTS version.  

So, go head and click the LTS version download link button and download it to your computer. Go through the installation process and the Node.js will be installed to your computer.

Now, we have installed the Node.js in our computer and how do we know actually that it is installed or not. 

Open a terminal and type the following command to check the version installed.

```shell
$ node -v
```
this will throw back the node version.
