### History of the JS
Initially, the JS was limited to the browser to handle the user interaction. I was used only in the browser related applications. The browser uses the javascript engine to run the javascript code and every browser has its own. Like Chrome has V8 engine, firefox has SpiderMonkey and so on...  

For the first time in 2009, using that V8 engine, we were able to run the server side javascript.

### Introduction 

... a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non blocking model that makes it lightweight and efficent. 

Node.js package ecosystem, npm is the largest ecosystem of the  open source libraries in the world.

- A platform which allows  us to run JavaScript on a computer/server.
- Read, delete and update files.
- easily communicates with the database(MySQL, Postgress, MongoDB ...).

**Q. Why Node.js?**
- It uses JavaScript
- very fast(runs on V8 engine and uses non-blocking code)
- huge ecosystem of open source packages(npm)
- great for real time application like chats
